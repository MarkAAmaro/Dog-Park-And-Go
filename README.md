# Dog Park and Go!

## Description

Our project aims to create a user friendly website that helps users find a dog park. The website will provide information about each park and show the current weather for the location entered.
As dog owners, we found it to be important for everyone to have a one stop shop for dog related activities. Our motivation for this project was to help dog owners be able to find the closest dog park to them based on the size of their dog.
As a group, we gained a multitude of knowledge. We were able to integrate the skills we have been taught over the past few weeks, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs into one application. We also developed an aptitude for collaborative work and coding as a cohesive team.

In the end we used four APIs: 
- the Dog CEO API to pull pictures of dogs based on their breed. 
- Google Maps API to pull nearby parks and their information based on user input and a corresponding map. 
- OpenWeather API to pull the current weather of the user based on their zip code. 
- And the Google Fonts API to get a fun dog font for our application.

## Usage

To use this application, visit this link: https://markaamaro.github.io/Dog-Park-And-Go/

The first page prompts you to enter how far you would like to walk with your dog to the nearest dog park or if you would like to drive within ten miles. [Home page for Dog Park & Go](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot1.png)

You enter your zip code and click "Let's Go!" [zip code input and "Let's Go!" button](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot2.png)

At the top of the next page there is a description on the benefits of walking your dog. [dog walking benefits](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot3.png)

Next you'll see the current weather for your location to decide if it's optimal dog walking weather. [current weather](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot4.png)

Beneath the weather will be a list of nearby parks with a picture, address, and link to more information. In this instance, the user chose a small distance from their location so there were a smaller number of results. You will see a max of four parks loaded at any time.[Nearby Parks: Stillwater Ranch Community Park](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot5.png)

Then there will be a corresponding map that will show where you can find the park in your city with a picture. [google map with pictures](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot6.png)

In the next section, we have additional information for pet owners including those who may be looking for a new dog. You can choose a breed from the drop down menu and it will populate a picture. [Dog Breeds: picture of affenpinscher](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot7.png)

Lastly, you will find will three resources to adopt a dog, get them groomed, and buy all the supplies you need to take care of your old or new companion. [Resources: picture of dog smiling](./assets/Images/ScreenShots/ScreenShot8.png)
